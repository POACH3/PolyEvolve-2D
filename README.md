# PolyEvolve 2D
This project uses a genetic algorithm to approximate an image.

The [first approach](https://github.com/POACH3/PolyEvolve-2D/tree/main/version_1) has been abandoned (for now) due to lack of convergence to a good approximation, despite significant simplification of target images and parameter experimentation.


### Possible Features
- a simple GUI
- parameter adjustment
  - set number of generations
  - set population size
  - fix number of polygons
  - fix or select range of number of polygon edges
  - fix color and opacity or set a palette
  - fix opacity
  - allow transparency
  - set background color and opacity
