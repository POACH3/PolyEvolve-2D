# PolyEvolve 2D
The intent of this project is to gain experience with genetic algorithms.

An image is input, then that image is approximated with polygons.

# Current Functionality
(nothing)

# Future Functionality
- a simple GUI to adjust parameters (fix number of polygons, colors, opacity, etc.)
- support for different image formats
